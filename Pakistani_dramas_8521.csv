The series is produced by Shazia Wajahat under banner Showcase Productions. It is set to premier on 6 October 2022 on ARY Digital with double episodes every week. The series stars Hadiqa Kiani, Omair Rana, with child actors Aashir Wajahat, Aina Asif, Muhammad Hassaan and Ahmed Usman in leading roles. *Story: The series received positive reviews due to its subject of parenting techniques and children's issues. Abaan (Ahmed Usman) is a troubled young kid, who lives in a very strict family. His interests lie in art and music, whereas his father Javed (Omair Rana) tells him that these are useless subjects and scolds him for pursuing them. Abaan's mother Khadjia (Hadiqa Kiani) is also very strict, but she understands Abaan's feelings and she can't stand up for herself against her husband. Abaan's older brother Azaan (Aashir Wajahat) is the good kid and he always makes his parents proud, whereas his sister Abeer (Aina Asif) is the complete opposite, since she has a phone, unbeknownst to her parents, and is very politically active on social media. Khadija's friend Wajiha (Sunita Marshall) is a divorcee since she had an abusive husband named Sheharyar. Her two kids, Fardan (Zuhab Khan) and Dua (Emaan Khan), both support her and so does her servant, Firoza Bi (Fareeha Jabeen). One day, Abaan fails his tests, and his father and sister both call him losers and a disappointment, and Javed threatens to send Abaan to boarding school, but Azaan convinces him that he will help Abaan study and be better at his studies. Khadija finds out about Abeer's phone, but her friend secretly gifts her another one. Abaan then befriends a rich kid named Bilal, and he gives Abaan drugs to get rid of his tensions. Abaan steals money from Javed's wallet to give to Bilal for the drugs. One day, Azaan becomes ""Head Boy"" of the university, but Abeer gets in trouble for bullying a girl on social media, and Abaan finds a kid named Umer trash talking Abeer. Abaan and Umer fight, but Abaan accidentally lets Umer fall over the balcony, sending him to the hospital. Since Umer is a rich kid, his father gets Abaan arrested. During the investigation, the school finds out about Abaan and the drugs, and they take this matter to court. But it turns out that Javed's lawyer is actually working for Umer's father and he says he will try to make sure that he won't let Abaan's bail happen. Wajiha meets Arsalan (Furqan Qureshi), who happens to be a lawyer, so Khadija tries to hire him, but Javed intervenes, thinking that Wajiha and Arsalan are having an affair, since he doesn't like Wajiha. *Cast: Hadiqa Kiani as Khadija Ali Siddiqui as Saleem Omair Rana as Javaid Aashir Wajahat as Azaan Ahmed Usman as Abaan Muhammad Hassaan as Abeer's Boyfriend Aina Asif as Abeer Sunita Marshall as Wajiha Emaan Khan as Dua Zuhab Khan as Fardan Fareeha Jabeen as Feroza Bi Jinaan Hussain as Rabia Zhalay Sarhadi as Fareeda, School Principal Furqan Qureshi as Arsalan Sharique Mehmood as Bakht *Production: Producer Shaiza Wajaht revealed in September 2021 that pre-production work on the last script of screenwriter and playwright Asma Nabeel, has been started.

668,669. Darya Kay Iss Paar (This Bank of the River),/title/tt13850756/?ref_=sr_i_669,2021,7.7,(16),Short,"""Darya Kay Iss Paar"" (This Bank of The River) is the story of a young girl who lives in the Northern region of Pakistan. Gull Zareen is facing depression due to many aspects of her life. The cold isolation of the mountainous area where she lives intensifies her problems. The pressures that began when she was a student are compounded after she marries. No one in her life acknowledges her feelings or thoughts. Rigid social values and norms add fuel to the fire. One gloomy dawn, she reaches a breaking point, plunges herself into the river, and drowns. This story depicts the typical cultural behavior of society towards mental illness. The heartrending tale is a roller-coaster ride of emotions that we hope will cause viewers to reflect on, and reconsider this too-common tragedy. The ghost of depression has been haunting humans since day one and committing suicide is one of the practical manifestations of it. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) every year approximately 1 million people die because of suicide and the rate of committing suicide is rising rapidly with the passage of time. Pakistan is no exception to the rising rate of suicide. Though the suicide rate is below in comparison with the global rate, yet in some areas, it is increasing day by day. The irony is that owing to some social taboos it is difficult to discuss and treat this social issue rationally. Despite having a high literacy rate, there are some areas where the suicide rate is constantly increasing. The film, ""Darya Kay Iss Paar"" is nothing but a humble effort to raise this issue at national and international levels. The essence behind this sincere effort is to table this stigmatized social evil and to trigger the debate, at least, in the battle against depression and mental illness.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhjNDM2OTctNWU0OS00ZTQ3LTk1NjEtMzI1YjYxMTE5ZjY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI4MjgyMzE5._V1_QL75_UX140_CR0,1,140,207_.jpg"

The film tells the story of Tania, a young woman who borrows a necklace from her friend to wear to a party. After the party, Tania realizes that she has lost the necklace and instead of confessing her mistake to her friend, she decides to replace the necklace herself. Tania and her Husband Arif plunges themselves into debt and poverty to buy a new necklace for Tania friend, working multiple jobs and sacrificing their own happiness to repay the debt. The film portrays the struggles and hardships that Tania and Arif faces in their quest to make things right, including losing their job, becoming homeless, and suffering from ill health. However, the film's shocking twist comes when Tania finally presents the new necklace to her friend, only to find out that the original necklace was a fake and worth only a fraction of the price she paid for the replacement.

Meerwala is a village without any roads, schools, a Police Station, or even electricity. Girls' marriages are arranged when they are barely 12 years old. During March, 2002, Shaqoor allegedly molests a girl from the Mashtoi family, who live next door. The local Panchayat meets and decides that Mukhtaran must also be molested by males of the Mashtoi family, accordingly she is raped by about 14 men. Shunned, hurt, confused, devastated, she makes her way to the Police Station to file a report against this rape. This is where she will find out that it is not easy to find justice in a country that has been ruled by men and the military for eons, where the woman is still considered a possession - when she does well, she lives up to the family's reputation, but when she does bad, she brings shame to the entire clan. Her persistence pays off, and with the intervention of two female politicians, she has the 14 arrested. Amidst threats made against her by the Mashtoi clan, she is provided 24 hours protection by the national guard. Shortly thereafter the Courts reached it's decision: 8 of the men are set free, while 6 are sentenced to be hanged and fined 40,000 Pakistani Rupees. The media's attention is focused on Meerwala, and Pervez Musharaff's government makes the most of it to improve conditions there. Mukhtaran is awarded 5 Lakh Rupees, which she uses to build a girls' school; a road & a Police station manned by 4 constables is built, and electricity is provided. Then a school is built for males named as Ghulam Fareed Boys' School. Ironically, while the government provides funding for the boys' school, Mukhtaran herself pays for the salaries and maintenance of the girls' school. When the accused appeal to the High Court, 5 of the 6 are freed, resulting in an uproar not only in Pakistan but also in the United States. Mukhtaran meets with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and has the 5 re-arrested. She is then invited to Spain. Thereafter, she is invited to visit the U.S., a visa is provided for her, but before she could travel, she is arrested by the Police under orders from Pervez Musharraff himself, so as not to publicly humiliate his country. Mukhtaran disappears for several days, only to emerge later, admitting that she has been coerced to not visit the U.S.. Subsequently, she does visit the U.S. where is felicitated by Glamour Magazine, while the Times New York cites her as one of 100 the most influential people in the world. When she returns home to Meerwala, she is shocked to learn that a nine year old girl has been raped, and files a Police Complaint on her behalf. During the course of the four years of her trials, Mukhtaran has not only built and run a school for girls, albeit with some donations collected by U.S.-based Journalist Nicholas Kristof; a woman's crisis center, but also a sense of security and well-being amongst the general population, especially women, in Meerwala. Add to that, a male student from the embittered Mashtoi family had also enrolled in the boys' school. She is herself enrolled in the girls' school, appropriately named after her, and hopes that by enlightening young minds she can make way for a better Pakistan. As of the end of 2006, the Pakistani Supreme is yet to decide the fate of the 6 accused in this incident.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA5ZTQ2YWMtNDVmMS00YzI1LWIyN2YtNTljM2U0Njk4NTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI4MjkyODQ@._V1_QL75_UY207_CR0,0,140,207_.jpg"

Voices from the Roof of the World,/title/tt25276010/?ref_=sr_i_1162,2021– ,,,TV Series,"Voices from the Roof of the World is a documentary series exploring how climate change has impacted the people and environment of the world's highest mountain region. Each of the 20 half-hour documentaries is directed by a local filmmaker from Pakistan, India, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan or Nepal under the direction of Executive Producer Andrew Tkach. The roof of the world, a great arc of glaciated mountains in Central and South Asia, is melting quickly. From the Tien Shan and Pamir mountains to the mighty Karakoram and Himalayan ranges, the planet's largest repository of ice outside the polar regions is in trouble. Hundreds of millions of people are directly at risk from avalanches, mudslides and drying pastures. Endangered snow leopards and Himalayan brown bears will definitely suffer, but so will 1.65 billion people dependent on Asia's mightiest rivers, many of which trace their origins to the region. This series captures the drama and the science of what is a planetary emergency. Besides focusing on mountain communities the series explores the impact of air pollution and rising temperatures in the world's most densely packed cities and how to plan ahead for the coming ""killer heat waves. "" In A Cry from the Mountains, a film capturing the impact of this summer's record-breaking floods in Pakistan, a survivor of glacial lake outburst floods in Gligit Baltistan recounts ""there is water draining down all around us. Everywhere you look, we've surrounded by rushing streams. This is no place to live, only for water to drain away."" The alarm bells are ringing throughout the world: the biggest floods in Pakistan's history and the world's highest temperatures, Mt. Everest base camp turned from a frigid outpost to a lakeside camp. These are all sign that climate change is accelerating while most countries are failing to meet their pledges to reduce their carbon output. The UN Special Rapporteur said that ""climate change is the largest most pervasive threat... the world has ever experienced, and the poorest countries are paying the heaviest price.

In the ultimate shuffle, the small-time hustler rises from the streets of Kharadar to Karachi's high society where his card-counting skill is recognized by the infamous Bawan Shah (Faisal Rehman). Shah, a legendary card-player himself and Siddiq's idol, has since moved on to secure a big stake in the city's underworld. A far cry from Kharadar, Shah's is an unflinching world of decadence and betrayal where nothing is ever what it seems to be. Beneath this layer of venality the real story lies: the bond between two men, one who is self-assured yet torn; and the other who desperately needs a mentor to give credence to his skill and entity. Thrust into this new environment, Siddiq experiences a speedy rise in fortune but risks alienating his friends and his love Shabana (Aamina Sheikh) who happens to be his best friend's sister. Shabana, the one person who brings out the real man behind ""Kanebaaz"", provides the steady dose of reality as Siddiq faces an impending moral downfall when his ties with Shah strengthen and unravel the true nature of 'business'. ""Kanebaz"" offers a harsh glimpse of Karachi, where a queen in the pocket doesn't always make one a king.

At the time his work caused some outrage and had him labeled blasphemous, it took some time for people to appreciate that their was no disrespect intended by him, but instead his complain...t to his Lord was one that arose from helplessness and confusion. He lived and witnesses a period of great socio-political turmoil, the rise and falls of nations and the decaying fabric of society. The Asian subcontinent was going through the most troublesome period in its history, whilst internationally the geo-political landscape was transforming from Imperial rule to the emergence of the 'Nation State ideology.' Dr Iqbal witnesses the moral values of community, tolerance and kinship eroding and being replaced by ethnic lines of social divide, he saw the advance of capitalism and the race for political and economic control taking over at the cost of humanity and equality. As a storyteller, Shikwa not only inspired me but I saw a tremendous relevance to the world we live in today, in a way Ashen Streets was my way of making the viewer ponder on the realities we face today. However this film is not a visualization of Shikwa but an attempt to make us reflect on our selves and our contribution to society, and how accountable we all are as individuals to the problems faced by the collective.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwMTk4NTItMWU1Mi00MDJmLThmMDgtMTFlMjQ0NjE4M2Y4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQ2MzI5NDM@._V1_QL75_UY207_CR7,0,140,207_.jpg"

1497,1498. Teri Raah Main Rul Gai,/title/tt6967942/?ref_=sr_i_1498,2012–2013,,,TV Series,"Written by Maimoona Khurshed, whose last play, 'Main Chand Si' on ARY was quite a rage. Here, she continues to dominate with a more melodramatic touch to an A&B drama and the best part is that it actually works. This play is now based on one of her popular novels with the same name. It starts off, with a young Zohra running in the rain towards the coffin of the dead husband. Coming back from the flashbacks, 18 years have passed from that tragic day and now everything has changed. Jahandad does not live with his family and has decided to turn his back on the wedding proposal that's holding his sister Husna and Chaudhry Sarfaraz's relationship together. Being a vatta-satta relation, Sarfaraz's sister, Rano is getting older day by day since being bethrothed to Jahandad. Malik Sahab, has another mentally imbalanced son, Karamdad apart from Jahandad and his dead older brother. Leaving the family politics aside, Jahandad decides to do a teaching job in the city. There he meets a young spoilt brat, Zubaaria. She has, issues with her father since he never ever speaks of her mother. Slowly and steadily, Zubaaria develops a keen interest in Jahandad. Zohra, realises that whatever is happening between Jahandad and her is just very wrong, but still she's unable to stop herself from falling for him. Will Jahandad be able to free Zohra from his manipulative father? Will true love prevail? Coming to the creatives, Amin Iqbal's direction is top notch here. The suspense created at the end of every episode is simply incredible. The cinematographer also deserves praise for fabulous use of lighting and scenery to increase the appeal of the drama. I love the fact that, great detailing has been taken care of here and the editing doesn't go helter-skelter like the other A&B plays. The OST by Fariha Pervez is a beautiful composition and completely suits the scenario and the background score fits like a pack. Sami Khan as Jahandad delivers one of his best performances here. Finally, his choice of projects has improved and so has his quality of acting. I believe, Sami Khan is a director's actor and he can be easily moulded to suit the capabilities of the actor. Once there are no ego hassles involved, then a good actor can escalate even a mediocore play to great heights. Initially, I was extremely apprehensive about Samiya Mumtaz playing the coveted role of Zohra, here. I had seen both Sami and Samiya play son-mother with such conviction in 'Maaye Ni' that it was very difficult to break that image of these two from there. But thankfully, Samiya has proved me wrong and how? Its now extremely difficult to imagine any other actress as Zohra-ji which speaks volumes for a lead actress. Yumna Zaidi has really managed to impress me here. I wasn't quite a fan of hers from 'Thakan' or even 'Khushi- Aik Roag' but in TRMRGW, her character of this crazy chulbuli si larki does leave quite an impact on you. The other cast members are very well suited. A very special mention to the actor playing 'Karamdad' for portraying the nuances of a mentally disabled character to such perfection.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM5ZjliNDctMjRlYS00YmM2LWE2NWQtMzAzMTcyMzA2ZGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjAyMjMzOTk@._V1_QL75_UY207_CR92,0,140,207_.jpg"

Symphorienne Kessouagni lives in rural Togo, where parents send their children to live with distant relatives because they can't afford to feed them or pay their school fees. They believe the children will do small chores in exchange for an education. Instead, the children end up in the hands of ""brokers"" who smuggle them across the border to a neighboring country and sell them. Tiny boys are forced to haul brutal heavy loads at markets. The girls are exploited as domestic servants. 32-year-old Symphorienne, visits these markets and border villages, slowly winning the trust of the child slaves and encouraging them to escape. She plays hardball with their exploiters and negotiates the children's freedom whenever possible. But she's a nurturing mother figure and a tough disciplinarian to 17 former child slaves, who live with her. Most either can't locate their parents or their families won't take them back. A firebrand Christian, Symphorienne struggles to help her children believe in a heavenly father who cares for them, even though their biological fathers have abandoned or sold them. Sunitha Krishnan is a former Hindu nun in Hyderabad, India, who presides over a much larger enterprise than Symphorienne's. Sunitha runs 17 schools for girls rescued from brothels and for the children of prostitutes, as well a center for HIV positive children, all infected through rape or prostitution. She regularly lobbies officials to enforce anti-slavery laws and pushes police to bust-up brothels. When they don't move fast enough for her, she organizes her own brothel raids.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVmOTMxMDQtZmRhZC00MjczLWE4ZGYtNDgwNWYwYzEyYTI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxNDUyNTQ@._V1_QL75_UY207_CR0,0,140,207_.jpg"

""The boy threw acid at me because he could not tolerate my parent's rejection of his proposal"" says Irum, ""Even today, I cannot forget the crooked smile on his face, as he ran off"". Brought to the hospital by a passer-by, Irum woke up in hospital, ""I asked my mother for a mirror, but she said there was nothing left look at"". When Musarrat Misbah, the owner of a Beauty Salon, met another victim, she decided to take action. Her foundation, Smile Again, is designed to bring hope to these women by providing them with the means to undergo reconstructive surgery and moral support. Because the victims endure, ""Not just physical, even stronger is the inner pain, the unbearable pain"". Musarrat travels throughout Pakistan to meet not only victims, but also other Pakistanis, trying to gain insight into the cause of such a devastating issue. In educated circles there is a firm desire to tackle the problem. Author Faryal Ali Gohar maintains, ""If this could be a nation where the rights that are granted to men and women by the constitution and religious texts were understood, then we would be happier"". A primitive male dominant culture combined with Sharia law has left some parts of Pakistani society convinced they have a right to brutalise women for any perceived sleight. However, Musarrat is committed to get these women standing on their feet again. Nashreem Sharif who lost her sight when her face was burnt with acid at the age of 15, is one of just many women who have benefited from her help. Both shocking and heart-breaking, this documentary shows not only the atrocious injustices that some women are subjected to in Pakistan, but also the beauty behind the scarred faces of these women who have only one wish: to put the past behind and smile again.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1OTg1NDk1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI2NzU3NjE@._V1_QL75_UX140_CR0,1,140,207_.jpg"

This calm moment contrasts with the brutality of their interventions on sites of accidents, drownings or murders, which we will never see - in any case, not for real. As here, the spectacle of violence and misfortune exists only through words, in dreams, or reconstructed for a TV show. Fake blood, but real suffering. That of the ambulance drivers confronted with death every day, that of the victims whose setbacks are mercilessly replayed for the entertainment of all, finally that of a society that drives its members to throw themselves off a bridge or poison their family. This off-screen irrigates the powerful reflection implemented by Shehrezad Maher who, over these sequences, constructs a dialectic that opposes memory and fiction, traumatism and fascination, whose permeable frontiers we permanently cross. The attention to the rituals, whether it's repainting an ambulance or rehearsing a scene inspired by a news item, then takes on full meaning, that of an internalised violence whose roots can be revealed by film alone.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAwMGQ4MDMtZGYzZS00NThlLWIyZWQtNDkwNjk1YTBlZWViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU5MjgzMDI@._V1_QL75_UY207_CR2,0,140,207_.jpg"

Revisit old memories with the new version Yeh Dooriyan' by Ovais Singstar and from the movie Love Aaj Kal. Jai (Saif Ali Khan)and Meera (Deepika Padukone) is a modern day couple in London. They are very happy together but do not believe in tying each other down. So when life pulls them in different directions, they decide to go with the flow. ""These Heer Ranjha, Romeo Juliet type janam janam ka saath type couples exist only in story books"", Jai says. In the real life, we have to be practical, says Jai. In another place and time, Veer Singh is struck by the thunderbolt when he sees Harleen for the first time. Soon after, he stands under a tree and swears that ""is janam mein aur har janam mein yehi meri votti banegi Harleen Kaur."" He travels a thousand kilometres by train to stand under her balcony only to have a glimpse of her face. And yet not speak a word with her. That was 1965 Calcutta. Today as Veer and Jai meet, Veer does not understand how Jai can treat matters of the heart without passion, like a financial transaction. Jai does not understand how Veer Singh could have been so naïve and silly about Harleen in the days of his youth. But as both stories unfold, we realize that the process of relationship might be different in different eras, but the experience of being in love remains the same. So there is the frolic and despair of modern living. The liberation and confusion. And there is the times of innocence and compulsion in the past. And there is distance, and the fondness that increases with distance. Gaps widen between two people, but bridges keep growing too.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY2Y2FkNzAtZDEzZC00NzE2LWExYmYtMDYwZDIzZGNmMGZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUwNDE0NTYy._V1_QL75_UX140_CR0,1,140,207_.jpg"

Srivalli is a song from the Movie Pushpa - The Rise. Pushpa Raj is a coolie who works to smuggle red sandalwood, a rare wood that only grows in the Seshachalam Hills of the Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh. When DSP Govindappa raids them in the forest, Pushpa hides and recovers the stock, thereby gaining the trust of his employer Konda Reddy. Pushpa meets Srivalli and instantly falls for her. On their engagement day, his half-brother Mohan denies Pushpa's lineage because he was born out of wedlock while his mother is injured in the ensuing scuffle. This angers Pushpa, which motivates him to rise higher in life. The next day, he smuggles the wood to Chennai and meets Srinu from whom he demands crore per ton as their share. Srinu refuses and his men attack him but Pushpa overpowers them. He then goes to Chennai himself and cuts a deal to sell the wood at crore per ton, which Konda and Pushpa agree to share equally. Jolly blackmails Srivalli to spend a night with him while holding her father captive. Enraged, Pushpa badly beats up Jolly, temporarily paralyzing him. Konda, finding out that Pushpa is responsible for his brother's condition, tries to kill him but Srinu's men ambush them. Amid the confusion, Pushpa manages to counterattack them. Konda is killed but Pushpa saves Konda's brother Jakka Reddy. He also captures Srinu's brother-in-law Mogileesu and kills him. MP Bhumireddy Siddappa Naidu arranges a truce between Pushpa and Srinu and appoints Pushpa to manage their syndicate. After 6 months, Pushpa becomes an influential person. Due to Srinu's inability to avenge his brother-in-law, his wife Dakshayani slits his throat which injures him. While Pushpa is at his prime, a ruthless police officer Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat takes charge as the district's SP. Pushpa offers him a bribe of 1 crore . Shekhawat, however, intimidates and ridicules Pushpa for his lineage and not giving respect by addressing him as ""Sir"". Pushpa gets angry by this insult and fists his fingers. Shekhawat threatens to shoot his hand if Pushpa does not unfold his fingers. In a desperate situation, Pushpa backs down and leaves the station. On the night of Pushpa's wedding, Pushpa and Shekhawat drink together. Expressing contempt on how he was ridiculed in their first meeting, Pushpa takes Shekhawat's revolver and shoots himself in his hands. He pressures Shekhawat to get undressed while he also does the same. Pushpa says that his stature as that of a syndicate boss remains the same nonetheless while Shekhawat is nothing without his police uniform to the extent that even his dog would not recognize him if he is naked. Pushpa leaves for his wedding while Shekhawat goes back home semi-naked. As predicted, his dog barks at him. Enraged, Shekhawat kills the dog and burns the bribe money given by Pushpa.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ0MDkxYjMtMWM4OC00NzhhLTgyYWYtYzViMjljNzA2ZTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUwNDE0NTYy._V1_QL75_UY207_CR3,0,140,207_.jpg"

3496,3497. The Unknown Mountaineer,/title/tt8096120/?ref_=sr_i_3497,2018,,,Short,"The film is about a group of aspiring women climbers from Shimshal, a remote valley in northern Pakistan. The documentary follows 18-year-old Hameeda Bibi and her friends who couldn't go to school and learnt technical high-altitude mountain climbing from the men in their community. These men work as porters and guides in mountain tourism which is the economic backbone of their area. Shimshal is at an altitude of 10,000ft and with single cropping, little grazing ground near the villages and a rugged terrain life is brutal and breeds people with a natural capacity for high-altitude mountaineering but sadly without the means to take their dreams forward. The men scrape a living by risking their lives in what is undeniably among the most dangerous sports in the world but many have developed a passion and inspired their women to follow their dreams as well with regular trainings to make these dreams possible. However, without the means, education and possibility of sponsorships the women are left living their simple lives of subsistence farming and yak herding though they have set national records in their country and even climbed a 20,000ft summit in the winter. This film aims to follow their expeditions while also showing the harshness of their lives. It aims to give the women, these Pakistani Sherpa the recognition they deserve. It's a story of strength, struggle and survival set in a breathtaking landscape about a people who dare to dream.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ1M2Q5NGQtZmUxYS00N2JiLTg4ZWUtZmU2MTM0MjM1NGFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODUzMjg1NTA@._V1_QL75_UY207_CR68,0,140,207_.jpg"

3796,3797. Mela Chiraghan: A Few Rhymes,/title/tt22474392/?ref_=sr_i_3797,2019,,,Short,"Mela Chiraghan or 'festival of lamps' is an annual festival commemorating the death anniversary of the Pujnabi Sufi poet and saint, Shah Hussain who lived in Lahore in the 16th century. The shrine where the festival takes place is situated at the outskirts of Lahore where Hussain is buried with his beloved, Madhu Lal, a Hindu boy. The names of the two lovers have unified to become one, Madhu Lal Hussain, symbolizing their inseparability even in death. With the arrival of spring, masses including an array of subaltern groups led by the Malangs (non-materialist who also rejects Shariah) of various orders, Mirasi (traditional musician caste in Punjab), transgender, mentally challenged and prostitutes from all across Pakistan flock to the shrine seeking wish fulfillment, blessings of the saint, states of ecstasy and union with the divine by means of a rainbow of ecstatic devotional rituals in conjunction with Dhamal (trance inducing dance) to the rhythm of Dhol (Punjabi percussion) and Langar (distribution of free food). Many practices and rituals associated with the Mela challenge mainstream notions of Islam and it is for this reason that in recent years the shrines in Pakistan have become targets of terror attacks carried out by the hardline Islamists. Despite attempts by the state to shift the narratives of Madho Lal Hussain's life and teachings and to inject conservative Islamic rituals such as Namaz Ba Jamat (collective prayers) and Naat recitation into the Mela Chiraghan, the occasion continues to be dominated by a Malang ethos.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNiMTRkM2MtZWJmOC00OWQzLTgwYzQtMTJlYWY5MWUxMzExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzMDQ4NjY@._V1_QL75_UY207_CR3,0,140,207_.jpg"

Set in the director's village of Khubai, Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province, Pakistan, the film takes an unvarnished approach to storytelling - letting the stories and the storytellers take center stage in 5 long takes that cover life, death, politics, religion and everything in between. The stories narrated in Pa Deyran Jang invariably touch upon crime and lawlessness, somewhat 'emblematic' of the province's 'frontier' status during the British Raj.",

Extremism and radicalism fortified after the emergence of Taliban and different concepts and definitions of religion perseveres in the minds of the people.

Defying the bitter experiences and the harsh surroundings that life has dealt her, the fire of Peeno's feminine warmth refuses to extinguish. Her potent feminine energy does not allow her to occupy the analytical mind for long, it immediately pushes her in the body and grounds her in the emotional realm. Her insatiable capacity to give love makes her vulnerable before egotistical men who bewitch her through their honeyed words, until one eventful night she is meted out extreme humiliation by one of her potential clients. Now consumed by fierce vindictive rage she sets out to tame the masculine. She will refuse to play the game anymore, expose her swindling lover and bring him to his knees. But will her short-lived conquest of a world destitute in humanity take away her inner sadness?","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjFlMzk0MWEtZmI2Ny00OTAwLTk0NzctMzQ1ZDM3OTk2ZDljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzMDQ4NjY@._V1_QL75_UX140_CR0,0,140,207_.jpg"

As our story progresses we see him brutally murder his wife but we also see flashbacks of their past, showing how much they once loved one another.

Our story explores several different concepts such as love, marriage, crimes of passion and even honor killing.

The Unknown Mountaineers,/title/tt8286512/?ref_=sr_i_4969,2018,,,,"The film is about a group of young women who are aspiring mountain climbers from Shimshal, a remote valley in northern Pakistan. The documentary follows 18-year-old Hameeda Bibi and her friends who couldn't go to school and learnt technical high-altitude mountain climbing from the men in their community. This is something almost unheard of in a conservative Islamic country. These men work as porters and guides in mountain tourism, which is the economic backbone of this area. Shimshal is at an altitude of 10,000ft and with single cropping, little grazing ground near the villages and a rugged terrain life is brutal and breeds people with a natural capacity for high-altitude mountaineering. The men scrape a living by risking their lives in what is undeniably among the most dangerous occupations in the world and yet they encourage their women to follow their dreams with regular trainings to make these dreams possible. However, without the means, education and possibility of sponsorships the women are left living their simple lives of subsistence farming and yak herding though they have set national records in their country and even climbed a 20,000ft summit in the winter! This film aims to follow their expeditions while also showing their culture and the harshness of their lives. It aims to give the women, these Pakistani Sherpa, the recognition they deserve. It's a story of strength, struggle and survival set in a breathtaking landscape about a people who dare to dream.",
