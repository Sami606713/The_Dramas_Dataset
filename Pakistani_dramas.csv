The series is produced by Shazia Wajahat under banner Showcase Productions. It is set to premier on 6 October 2022 on ARY Digital with double episodes every week. The series stars Hadiqa Kiani, Omair Rana, with child actors Aashir Wajahat, Aina Asif, Muhammad Hassaan and Ahmed Usman in leading roles. *Story: The series received positive reviews due to its subject of parenting techniques and children's issues. Abaan (Ahmed Usman) is a troubled young kid, who lives in a very strict family. His interests lie in art and music, whereas his father Javed (Omair Rana) tells him that these are useless subjects and scolds him for pursuing them. Abaan's mother Khadjia (Hadiqa Kiani) is also very strict, but she understands Abaan's feelings and she can't stand up for herself against her husband. Abaan's older brother Azaan (Aashir Wajahat) is the good kid and he always makes his parents proud, whereas his sister Abeer (Aina Asif) is the complete opposite, since she has a phone, unbeknownst to her parents, and is very politically active on social media. Khadija's friend Wajiha (Sunita Marshall) is a divorcee since she had an abusive husband named Sheharyar. Her two kids, Fardan (Zuhab Khan) and Dua (Emaan Khan), both support her and so does her servant, Firoza Bi (Fareeha Jabeen). One day, Abaan fails his tests, and his father and sister both call him losers and a disappointment, and Javed threatens to send Abaan to boarding school, but Azaan convinces him that he will help Abaan study and be better at his studies. Khadija finds out about Abeer's phone, but her friend secretly gifts her another one. Abaan then befriends a rich kid named Bilal, and he gives Abaan drugs to get rid of his tensions. Abaan steals money from Javed's wallet to give to Bilal for the drugs. One day, Azaan becomes ""Head Boy"" of the university, but Abeer gets in trouble for bullying a girl on social media, and Abaan finds a kid named Umer trash talking Abeer. Abaan and Umer fight, but Abaan accidentally lets Umer fall over the balcony, sending him to the hospital. Since Umer is a rich kid, his father gets Abaan arrested. During the investigation, the school finds out about Abaan and the drugs, and they take this matter to court. But it turns out that Javed's lawyer is actually working for Umer's father and he says he will try to make sure that he won't let Abaan's bail happen.

415. Darya Kay Iss Paar (This Bank of the River),/title/tt13850756/?ref_=sr_i_415,2021,7.7,(16),Short,"""Darya Kay Iss Paar"" (This Bank of The River) is the story of a young girl who lives in the Northern region of Pakistan. Gull Zareen is facing depression due to many aspects of her life. The cold isolation of the mountainous area where she lives intensifies her problems. The pressures that began when she was a student are compounded after she marries. No one in her life acknowledges her feelings or thoughts. Rigid social values and norms add fuel to the fire. One gloomy dawn, she reaches a breaking point, plunges herself into the river, and drowns. This story depicts the typical cultural behavior of society towards mental illness. The heartrending tale is a roller-coaster ride of emotions that we hope will cause viewers to reflect on, and reconsider this too-common tragedy. The ghost of depression has been haunting humans since day one and committing suicide is one of the practical manifestations of it. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) every year approximately 1 million people die because of suicide and the rate of committing suicide is rising rapidly with the passage of time. Pakistan is no exception to the rising rate of suicide. Though the suicide rate is below in comparison with the global rate, yet in some areas, it is increasing day by day. The irony is that owing to some social taboos it is difficult to discuss and treat this social issue rationally. Despite having a high literacy rate, there are some areas where the suicide rate is constantly increasing. The film, ""Darya Kay Iss Paar"" is nothing but a humble effort to raise this issue at national and international levels. The essence behind this sincere effort is to table this stigmatized social evil and to trigger the debate, at least, in the battle against depression and mental illness.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhjNDM2OTctNWU0OS00ZTQ3LTk1NjEtMzI1YjYxMTE5ZjY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI4MjgyMzE5._V1_QL75_UX140_CR0,1,140,207_.jpg","['Drama', 'Family', 'Back to top']","['Ahsan Khan', 'Saira Khan', 'Firdaus Jamal', 'Kanwal']"

Tania and her Husband Arif plunges themselves into debt and poverty to buy a new necklace for Tania friend, working multiple jobs and sacrificing their own happiness to repay the debt.

In the ultimate shuffle, the small-time hustler rises from the streets of Kharadar to Karachi's high society where his card-counting skill is recognized by the infamous Bawan Shah (Faisal Rehman). Shah, a legendary card-player himself and Siddiq's idol, has since moved on to secure a big stake in the city's underworld. A far cry from Kharadar, Shah's is an unflinching world of decadence and betrayal where nothing is ever what it seems to be. Beneath this layer of venality the real story lies: the bond between two men, one who is self-assured yet torn; and the other who desperately needs a mentor to give credence to his skill and entity. Thrust into this new environment, Siddiq experiences a speedy rise in fortune but risks alienating his friends and his love Shabana (Aamina Sheikh) who happens to be his best friend's sister. Shabana, the one person who brings out the real man behind ""Kanebaaz"", provides the steady dose of reality as Siddiq faces an impending moral downfall when his ties with Shah strengthen and unravel the true nature of 'business'.

At the time his work caused some outrage and had him labeled blasphemous, it took some time for people to appreciate that their was no disrespect intended by him, but instead his complain...t to his Lord was one that arose from helplessness and confusion. He lived and witnesses a period of great socio-political turmoil, the rise and falls of nations and the decaying fabric of society. The Asian subcontinent was going through the most troublesome period in its history, whilst internationally the geo-political landscape was transforming from Imperial rule to the emergence of the 'Nation State ideology.' Dr Iqbal witnesses the moral values of community, tolerance and kinship eroding and being replaced by ethnic lines of social divide, he saw the advance of capitalism and the race for political and economic control taking over at the cost of humanity and equality. As a storyteller, Shikwa not only inspired me but I saw a tremendous relevance to the world we live in today, in a way Ashen Streets was my way of making the viewer ponder on the realities we face today. However this film is not a visualization of Shikwa but an attempt to make us reflect on our selves and our contribution to society, and how accountable we all are as individuals to the problems faced by the collective.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwMTk4NTItMWU1Mi00MDJmLThmMDgtMTFlMjQ0NjE4M2Y4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQ2MzI5NDM@._V1_QL75_UY207_CR7,0,140,207_.jpg","['Drama', 'Back to top']","['Nadeem Baig', 'Shehla Gill', 'Kaveeta', 'Ghulam Mohiuddin', 'Sangeeta']"

767. Teri Raah Main Rul Gai,/title/tt6967942/?ref_=sr_i_767,2012–2013,,,TV Series,"Written by Maimoona Khurshed, whose last play, 'Main Chand Si' on ARY was quite a rage. Here, she continues to dominate with a more melodramatic touch to an A&B drama and the best part is that it actually works. This play is now based on one of her popular novels with the same name. It starts off, with a young Zohra running in the rain towards the coffin of the dead husband. Coming back from the flashbacks, 18 years have passed from that tragic day and now everything has changed. Jahandad does not live with his family and has decided to turn his back on the wedding proposal that's holding his sister Husna and Chaudhry Sarfaraz's relationship together. Being a vatta-satta relation, Sarfaraz's sister, Rano is getting older day by day since being bethrothed to Jahandad. Malik Sahab, has another mentally imbalanced son, Karamdad apart from Jahandad and his dead older brother. Leaving the family politics aside, Jahandad decides to do a teaching job in the city. There he meets a young spoilt brat, Zubaaria. She has, issues with her father since he never ever speaks of her mother. Slowly and steadily, Zubaaria develops a keen interest in Jahandad. Zohra, realises that whatever is happening between Jahandad and her is just very wrong, but still she's unable to stop herself from falling for him. Will Jahandad be able to free Zohra from his manipulative father? Will true love prevail? Coming to the creatives, Amin Iqbal's direction is top notch here. The suspense created at the end of every episode is simply incredible. The cinematographer also deserves praise for fabulous use of lighting and scenery to increase the appeal of the drama. I love the fact that, great detailing has been taken care of here and the editing doesn't go helter-skelter like the other A&B plays. The OST by Fariha Pervez is a beautiful composition and completely suits the scenario and the background score fits like a pack. Sami Khan as Jahandad delivers one of his best performances here. Finally, his choice of projects has improved and so has his quality of acting. I believe, Sami Khan is a director's actor and he can be easily moulded to suit the capabilities of the actor. Once there are no ego hassles involved, then a good actor can escalate even a mediocore play to great heights. Initially, I was extremely apprehensive about Samiya Mumtaz playing the coveted role of Zohra, here. I had seen both Sami and Samiya play son-mother with such conviction in 'Maaye Ni' that it was very difficult to break that image of these two from there. But thankfully, Samiya has proved me wrong and how? Its now extremely difficult to imagine any other actress as Zohra-ji which speaks volumes for a lead actress. Yumna Zaidi has really managed to impress me here. I wasn't quite a fan of hers from 'Thakan' or even 'Khushi- Aik Roag' but in TRMRGW, her character of this crazy chulbuli si larki does leave quite an impact on you. The other cast members are very well suited. A very special mention to the actor playing 'Karamdad' for portraying the nuances of a mentally disabled character to such perfection.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM5ZjliNDctMjRlYS00YmM2LWE2NWQtMzAzMTcyMzA2ZGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjAyMjMzOTk@._V1_QL75_UY207_CR92,0,140,207_.jpg","['Drama', 'Back to top']","['Faridur Reza Sagar', 'Keka Ferdousi']"

""The boy threw acid at me because he could not tolerate my parent's rejection of his proposal"" says Irum, ""Even today, I cannot forget the crooked smile on his face, as he ran off"". Brought to the hospital by a passer-by, Irum woke up in hospital, ""I asked my mother for a mirror, but she said there was nothing left look at"". When Musarrat Misbah, the owner of a Beauty Salon, met another victim, she decided to take action. Her foundation, Smile Again, is designed to bring hope to these women by providing them with the means to undergo reconstructive surgery and moral support. Because the victims endure, ""Not just physical, even stronger is the inner pain, the unbearable pain"". Musarrat travels throughout Pakistan to meet not only victims, but also other Pakistanis, trying to gain insight into the cause of such a devastating issue. In educated circles there is a firm desire to tackle the problem. Author Faryal Ali Gohar maintains, ""If this could be a nation where the rights that are granted to men and women by the constitution and religious texts were understood, then we would be happier"". A primitive male dominant culture combined with Sharia law has left some parts of Pakistani society convinced they have a right to brutalise women for any perceived sleight. However, Musarrat is committed to get these women standing on their feet again. Nashreem Sharif who lost her sight when her face was burnt with acid at the age of 15, is one of just many women who have benefited from her help. Both shocking and heart-breaking, this documentary shows not only the atrocious injustices that some women are subjected to in Pakistan, but also the beauty behind the scarred faces of these women who have only one wish: to put the past behind and smile again.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1OTg1NDk1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI2NzU3NjE@._V1_QL75_UX140_CR0,1,140,207_.jpg","['Drama', 'Back to top']","['Srha Asghar', 'Javed Iqbal', 'Kasim Khan', 'Mashal Khan', 'Atia Malik', 'Sunita Marshall', 'Agha Talal', 'Haris Waheed', 'Mizna Waqas', 'Maria Wasti']"
