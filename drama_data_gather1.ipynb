Here, she continues to dominate with a more melodramatic touch to an A&B drama and the best part is that it actually works. This play is now based on one of her popular novels with the same name. It starts off, with a young Zohra running in the rain towards the coffin of the dead husband. Coming back from the flashbacks, 18 years have passed from that tragic day and now everything has changed. Jahandad does not live with his family and has decided to turn his back on the wedding proposal that's holding his sister Husna and Chaudhry Sarfaraz's relationship together.

There he meets a young spoilt brat, Zubaaria. She has, issues with her father since he never ever speaks of her mother. Slowly and steadily, Zubaaria develops a keen interest in Jahandad. Zohra, realises that whatever is happening between Jahandad and her is just very wrong, but still she's unable to stop herself from falling for him. Will Jahandad be able to free Zohra from his manipulative father? Will true love prevail? Coming to the creatives, Amin Iqbal's direction is top notch here. The suspense created at the end of every episode is simply incredible. The cinematographer also deserves praise for fabulous use of lighting and scenery to increase the appeal of the drama. I love the fact that, great detailing has been taken care of here and the editing doesn't go helter-skelter like the other A&B plays. The OST by Fariha Pervez is a beautiful composition and completely suits the scenario and the background score fits like a pack. Sami Khan as Jahandad delivers one of his best performances here. Finally, his choice of projects has improved and so has his quality of acting. I believe, Sami Khan is a director's actor and he can be easily moulded to suit the capabilities of the actor. Once there are no ego hassles involved, then a good actor can escalate even a mediocore play to great heights. Initially, I was extremely apprehensive about Samiya Mumtaz playing the coveted role of Zohra, here. I had seen both Sami and Samiya play son-mother with such conviction in 'Maaye Ni' that it was very difficult to break that image of these two from there. But thankfully, Samiya has proved me wrong and how? Its now extremely difficult to imagine any other actress as Zohra-ji which speaks volumes for a lead actress. Yumna Zaidi has really managed to impress me here. I wasn't quite a fan of hers from 'Thakan' or even 'Khushi- Aik Roag' but in TRMRGW, her character of this crazy chulbuli si larki does leave quite an impact on you.
